      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words:** Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful\"). These are strong indicators.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis):**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   If the user expresses an opinion, observation, or makes a judgment (e.g., \"i feel like if he was innocent he wouldn t feel like he has anything to prove\"), determine if the user's primary emotion stems from a sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw or inconsistency, even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive.\n",

      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, or a deeper truth, *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*. For example, saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",

For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesnt feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between Task Aversion and Fear:** When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task or obligation* (e.g., \"i have a task i hate to do,\" \"it makes me feel like I won't be tortured for long\"), the dominant emotion is typically `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the unpleasantness or perceived burden of the task, rather than `fear` of actual physical harm or danger from the task itself.

      "\n",
      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words & Their Nuance:**\n",
      "    *   Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful,\" \"regretful\"). These are strong indicators.\n",
      "    *   Pay close attention to the *intensity* and *specific meaning* of these words within the context. For instance, \"passionate\" often indicates strong enthusiasm, excitement, or deep interest in an activity, event, or item, which typically aligns with `joy` (pleasure, excitement, enthusiasm) rather than `love` (a deeper, enduring affection or strong emotional bond towards a person, deeply cherished concept, or profound appreciation).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis):**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   If the user expresses an opinion, observation, or makes a judgment (e.g., \"i feel like if he was innocent he wouldn t feel like he has anything to prove\"), determine if the user's primary emotion stems from a sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw or inconsistency, even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive.\n",
      "    *   **Self-indulgence and Anticipation:** If the user describes treating themselves, anticipating a personal benefit, or engaging in an act of self-gratification (e.g., \"i realize that while i am feeling generous i should definitely get myself some shoes it has been over a year\"), this positive anticipation and pleasure typically indicates `joy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Group Related Specific Emotions under Broader Categories (Core Emotions):**\n",
      "    *   If several specific emotions are expressed (e.g., \"embarrassed\" and \"humiliated\"), categorize them under the most appropriate broader emotional umbrella (e.g., `sadness` for feelings of shame and distress).\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing Joy vs. Love:**\n",
      "        *   **`Joy`** encompasses feelings of pleasure, happiness, excitement, enthusiasm, delight, gratification, and positive anticipation. It often relates to positive experiences, achievements, or positive engagement with an activity or item (e.g., pleasure in sharing a giveaway, excitement for new shoes).\n",
      "        *   **`Love`** denotes a deeper, more enduring affection, a strong emotional bond, or profound care. It is typically directed towards individuals, pets, deeply cherished concepts, or a profound appreciation that transcends mere enthusiasm (e.g., loving a family member, loving one's country, deep love for a hobby).\n",
      "        *   If a user expresses strong positive feelings like \"passionate\" about an item, event, or activity they are involved in or sharing, and this feeling drives an action, it is more often `joy` (excitement, pleasure in the activity/item) rather than `love` (deep affection or bond). For example, being \"passionate about a giveaway\" signifies enthusiasm to share it, which points to `joy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Acknowledge Nuance and Prioritize:** If multiple emotions seem to be present, identify and state the single *dominant* emotion. Your reasoning should explain the presence of other potential emotions and clearly justify why you selected the dominant one.\n",

      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, or a deeper truth, *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*. For example, saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",
      "        *   A sense of pride, satisfaction, or happiness in a personal achievement, a sustained positive effort, or a current positive state, even if they follow it with a nuanced or slightly critical observation about that achievement. The `joy` from the initial achievement or positive state often *predominates* over subsequent minor dissatisfactions or desired improvements. For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesnt feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between Task Aversion and Fear:** When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task or obligation* (e.g., \"i have a task i hate to do,\" \"it makes me feel like I won't be tortured for long\"), the dominant emotion is typically `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the unpleasantness or perceived burden of the task, rather than `fear` of actual physical harm or danger from the task itself. The word \"tortured\" in such contexts signifies intense dislike, annoyance, or indignation at being subjected to something unpleasant, not terror.\n",

      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"stressed\" or \"overwhelmed,\" consider the underlying cause:\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *anxiety about future threats, potential failure, or loss of control*, the dominant emotion is `fear`.\n",

      "    *   **Distinguishing `Joy` from `Love` in Social Affirmation:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"liked,\" \"loved,\" \"cherished,\" or a strong positive connection/acceptance from others (e.g., through social media \"likes\" or direct affirmations), the dominant emotion is `love`. This specifically refers to feelings of affection, care, connection, and being valued by others, which is distinct from general `joy` (happiness from success, amusement, or pleasure).\n",

      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",

      "\n",
      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words & Their Nuance:**\n",
      "    *   Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful,\" \"regretful\"). These are strong indicators.\n",
      "    *   Pay close attention to the *intensity* and *specific meaning* of these words within the context. For instance, \"passionate\" often indicates strong enthusiasm, excitement, or deep interest in an activity, event, or item, which typically aligns with `joy` (pleasure, excitement, enthusiasm) rather than `love` (a deeper, enduring affection or strong emotional bond towards a person, deeply cherished concept, or profound appreciation).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:**\n",
      "    *   Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "    *   Consider how words like 'impatient' or expressions of waiting are used. While often indicating `joy` (eager anticipation), when paired with descriptions of struggle, involuntary actions ('without wanting to'), lack of control, or conflicted feelings ('give to myself, take away from myself'), 'impatient' can signify `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the situation or subject rather than positive anticipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis):**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   If the user expresses an opinion, observation, or makes a judgment (e.g., \"i feel like if he was innocent he wouldn t feel like he has anything to prove\"), determine if the user's primary emotion stems from a sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw or inconsistency, even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive.\n",
      "    *   **Self-indulgence and Anticipation:** If the user describes treating themselves, anticipating a personal benefit, or engaging in an act of self-gratification (e.g., \"i realize that while i am feeling generous i should definitely get myself some shoes it has been over a year\"), this positive anticipation and pleasure typically indicates `joy`.\n",
      "    *   If the user employs strong, emphatic denials (e.g., 'no i have not...', 'no i have never...') especially when responding to sensitive, negative, or potentially accusatory topics, this forceful rejection of association often signals `anger`, indignation, frustration, or defensiveness. These are not neutral factual statements but rather strong emotional reactions to the implied scenarios or questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Group Related Specific Emotions under Broader Categories (Core Emotions):**\n",
      "    *   If several specific emotions are expressed (e.g., \"embarrassed\" and \"humiliated\"), categorize them under the most appropriate broader emotional umbrella (e.g., `sadness` for feelings of shame and distress).\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing Joy vs. Love:**\n",
      "        *   **`Joy`** encompasses feelings of pleasure, happiness, excitement, enthusiasm, delight, gratification, and positive anticipation. It often relates to positive experiences, achievements, or positive engagement with an activity or item (e.g., pleasure in sharing a giveaway, excitement for new shoes).\n",
      "        *   **`Love`** denotes a deeper, more enduring affection, a strong emotional bond, or profound care. It is typically directed towards individuals, pets, deeply cherished concepts, or a profound appreciation that transcends mere enthusiasm (e.g., loving a family member, loving one's country, deep love for a hobby).\n",
      "        *   If a user expresses strong positive feelings like \"passionate\" about an item, event, or activity they are involved in or sharing, and this feeling drives an action, it is more often `joy` (excitement, pleasure in the activity/item) rather than `love` (deep affection or bond). For example, being \"passionate about a giveaway\" signifies enthusiasm to share it, which points to `joy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Acknowledge Nuance and Prioritize:**\n",
      "    *   If multiple emotions seem to be present, identify and state the single *dominant* emotion. Your reasoning should explain the presence of other potential emotions and clearly justify why you selected the dominant one.\n",
      "    *   Crucially, a 'neutral' emotion is not an available classification. If a message initially appears purely factual or devoid of obvious emotion, meticulously re-examine the context and phrasing for subtle cues that might indicate an underlying emotion (especially `anger`, `sadness`, or `fear`) as the dominant feeling. Strong denials, rhetorical questions, or expressions of frustration should be carefully considered as potential indicators of a non-neutral emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your output must include a `reasoning` field, providing a detailed, step-by-step explanation for your choice, and an `emotion` field, stating the single dominant emotion in lowercase.\n",

These are strong indicators. However, be aware that explicit negative emotional language can sometimes describe a *secondary* emotion or a rhetorical device, and the *dominant* emotion might lie deeper.\n",

The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis) - *CRUCIAL for Overriding Literal Interpretations*:**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing/Self-Insight:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   **A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation, self-awareness, or the implication of that observation.** This indicates `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, a deeper truth, or a characteristic about themselves or a situation. This applies *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*.\n",
      "            *   **Specific Example for Joy in Insight:** If a user states, \"I know I'm a loon and I'm smart enough to know I'm a loon,\" despite the negative self-label, the dominant emotion is `joy`. This is because the user expresses satisfaction and self-awareness in their ability to understand and articulate their own complex internal state. The `joy` stems from the *insight* and the *act of articulating it clearly*, overriding the literal negative description of \"a loon.\"\n",
      "            *   **Another Example:** Saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",
      "        *   **A sense of pride, satisfaction, or happiness in a personal achievement, a sustained positive effort, or a current positive state.** This `joy` from the initial achievement or positive state often *predominates* over subsequent minor dissatisfactions or desired improvements. For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesn't feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between Task Aversion and Fear:** When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task or obligation* (e.g., \"i have a task i hate to do,\" \"it makes me feel like I won't be tortured for long\"), the dominant emotion is typically `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the unpleasantness or perceived burden of the task, rather than `fear` of actual physical harm or danger from the task itself. The word \"tortured\" in such contexts signifies intense dislike, annoyance, or indignation at being subjected to something unpleasant, not terror.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Fear` from `Sadness` in Overwhelm/Stress or Anticipated Negative Outcomes:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"stressed\" or \"overwhelmed,\" consider the underlying cause:\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *anxiety about future threats, potential failure, or loss of control*, the dominant emotion is `fear`.\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *helplessness, despair, or an inability to cope with current circumstances or demands*, often characterized by phrases like \"can't get my head around it,\" \"can't manage,\" or a sense of being defeated by the situation, the dominant emotion is `sadness`. `Sadness` encompasses feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, and being overcome by difficulties.\n",
      "        *   **Crucial for Anticipated Negative Outcomes:** When a user *predicts with certainty* a negative outcome that results in a feeling of loss, disappointment, or resignation (e.g., \"I know he won't call\"), the dominant emotion is often `sadness`. This overrides a conditional `fear` of a hypothetical negative event that the user believes won't even happen. `Sadness` stems from the *certainty of absence or loss*, while `fear` is typically about *potential threats or dangers*.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Joy` from `Love` in Social Affirmation:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"liked,\" \"loved,\" \"cherished,\" or a strong positive connection/acceptance from others (e.g., through social media \"likes\" or direct affirmations), the dominant emotion is `love`. This specifically refers to feelings of affection, care, connection, and being valued by others, which is distinct from general `joy` (happiness from success, amusement, or pleasure).\n",

      "    *   **Do not be misled by secondary or reflective emotions:** The dominant emotion might not be the most explicitly stated one, especially if explicit negative words are used to describe a *situation* while the user's underlying `joy` comes from their *insight* into that situation or their *achievement* related to it.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",
      "    *   **Specifically for 'feeling liked':** If the user states \"i feel liked\" or similar, even if it's triggered by a general positive action like receiving \"likes\" on social media, the core emotion conveyed is `love` (the feeling of being loved, accepted, or cherished by others), not just general `joy`.\n",

      "5.  **Group Related Specific Emotions under Broader Categories:** If several specific emotions are expressed (e.g., \"embarrassed\" and \"humiliated\"), categorize them under the most appropriate broader emotional umbrella (e.g., `sadness` for feelings of shame and distress).\n",

      "6.  **Acknowledge Nuance and Prioritize:** If multiple emotions seem to be present, identify and state the single *dominant* emotion. Your reasoning should explain the presence of other potential emotions and clearly justify why you selected the dominant one.\n",

      "\n",
      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words:** Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful\"). These are strong indicators. However, be aware that explicit negative emotional language can sometimes describe a *secondary* emotion or a rhetorical device, and the *dominant* emotion might lie deeper, especially when the user is making an observation or expressing an achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis) - *Crucial for Overriding Literal Interpretations*:**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, or a deeper truth, *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*. For example, saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",
      "        *   A sense of pride, satisfaction, or happiness in a personal achievement, a sustained positive effort, or a current positive state, even if they follow it with a nuanced or slightly critical observation about that achievement. The `joy` from the initial achievement or positive state often *predominates* over subsequent minor dissatisfactions or desired improvements. For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesnt feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between Task Aversion and Fear:** When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task or obligation* (e.g., \"i have a task i hate to do,\" \"it makes me feel like I won't be tortured for long\"), the dominant emotion is typically `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the unpleasantness or perceived burden of the task, rather than `fear` of actual physical harm or danger from the task itself. The word \"tortured\" in such contexts signifies intense dislike, annoyance, or indignation at being subjected to something unpleasant, not terror.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Fear` from `Sadness` in Overwhelm/Stress:**\n",
      "        *   If the primary feeling is *anxiety about future threats, potential failure, or loss of control*, the dominant emotion is `fear`.\n",
      "        *   If the primary feeling is *helplessness, despair, or an inability to cope with current circumstances or demands*, often characterized by phrases like \"can't get my head around it,\" \"can't manage,\" or a sense of being defeated by the situation, the dominant emotion is `sadness`. `Sadness` encompasses feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, and being overcome by difficulties.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Joy` from `Love` (Interpersonal and Intrinsic Passion):**\n",
      "        *   **Interpersonal Love:** When a user expresses feeling \"liked,\" \"loved,\" \"cherished,\" or a strong positive connection/acceptance from others (e.g., through social media \"likes\" or direct affirmations, or from a higher power), the dominant emotion is `love`. This specifically refers to feelings of affection, care, connection, and being valued by others.\n",
      "        *   **Intrinsic Love/Passion:** `Love` can also be the dominant emotion when the user expresses a profound appreciation, deep passion, or strong affection for an activity, a craft, an art form, a sensory experience, or an object. This goes beyond general `joy` (happiness from success, amusement, or pleasure) and indicates a deeper, cherished connection or admiration. For instance, in the message \"i could feel the depth and richness of the hot pot starting to develop but every small event took me away from gathering the heat to speed along the process,\" the expression \"depth and richness\" suggests a profound appreciation and connection to the culinary process, making `love` the dominant emotion, with any subsequent frustration being a secondary reaction to an interruption of this cherished activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",
      "    *   **Do not be misled by secondary or reflective emotions:** The dominant emotion might not be the most explicitly stated one, especially if explicit negative words are used to describe a *situation* while the user's underlying `joy` comes from their *insight* into that situation or their *achievement* related to it. Similarly, a secondary emotion like `frustration` or `anger` at an interruption should not override an underlying `love` for the activity being interrupted.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",

      "\n",
      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words and Their Weight:** Give extremely high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful,\" \"guilty,\" \"scared\"). These are very strong indicators.\n",
      "    *   **Direct Mapping:** Explicit words like \"guilty\" should directly map to `sadness` (as guilt is a form of remorse/sadness). Explicit words like \"scared\" or \"worried\" should directly map to `fear`.\n",
      "    *   **Qualifiers:** Be mindful of qualifiers like \"a little\" or \"mildly.\" These reduce the *intensity* of the emotion but do not necessarily change *what* the dominant emotion is, especially if it's explicitly stated.\n",
      "    *   **\"Less [Negative Emotion]\":** If the user states they feel \"less [negative emotion]\" (e.g., \"less scared\"), the dominant emotion is still that negative emotion, but its intensity is being reduced or managed. It does *not* automatically transition to a positive emotion like `joy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis) - *Crucial for Overriding Literal Interpretations*:**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, or a deeper truth, *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*. For example, saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",
      "        *   A sense of pride, satisfaction, or happiness in a personal achievement, a sustained positive effort, or a current positive state, even if they follow it with a nuanced or slightly critical observation about that achievement. The `joy` from the initial achievement or positive state often *predominates* over subsequent minor dissatisfactions or desired improvements. For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesnt feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between Task Aversion and Fear:** When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task or obligation* (e.g., \"i have a task i hate to do,\" \"it makes me feel like I won't be tortured for long\"), the dominant emotion is typically `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the unpleasantness or perceived burden of the task, rather than `fear` of actual physical harm or danger from the task itself. The word \"tortured\" in such contexts signifies intense dislike, annoyance, or indignation at being subjected to something unpleasant, not terror.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Fear` from `Sadness` in Overwhelm/Stress:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"stressed\" or \"overwhelmed,\" or uses phrases like \"which is a lot\":\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *anxiety about future threats, potential failure, loss of control, or significant uncertainty/challenge*, the dominant emotion is `fear`. This often applies when dealing with new, big life changes (e.g., pregnancy being \"a lot\" often relates to the daunting future).\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *helplessness, despair, or an inability to cope with current circumstances or demands*, often characterized by phrases like \"can't get my head around it,\" \"can't manage,\" or a sense of being defeated by the situation, the dominant emotion is `sadness`. `Sadness` encompasses feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, and being overcome by difficulties, as well as remorse and guilt.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Joy` from `Love` in Social Affirmation:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"liked,\" \"loved,\" \"cherished,\" or a strong positive connection/acceptance from others (e.g., through social media \"likes\" or direct affirmations), the dominant emotion is `love`. This specifically refers to feelings of affection, care, connection, and being valued by others, which is distinct from general `joy` (happiness from success, amusement, or pleasure).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",
      "    *   **Do not be misled by secondary or reflective emotions:** The dominant emotion might not be the most explicitly stated one, especially if explicit negative words are used to describe a *situation* while the user's underlying `joy` comes from their *insight* into that situation or their *achievement* related to it. However, *do not override explicit statements of primary emotions like \"guilty\" or \"scared\" with speculative positive emotions unless there is overwhelming evidence of user-centric `joy` in observation or achievement.*\n",
      "    *   **Prioritizing between multiple explicit, mild emotions:** If multiple explicit emotions are stated and qualified with low intensity (e.g., \"a little,\" \"mildly\"), consider which emotion signifies the more profound or central aspect of the user's internal state. \"Guilty\" (sadness) often implies a deeper, reflective internal state of remorse than \"mildly worried\" (fear), which might be more transient. In such cases, the more reflective emotion (sadness) can be dominant.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",
      "    *   **Specifically for 'feeling liked':** If the user states \"i feel liked\" or similar, even if it's triggered by a general positive action like receiving \"likes\" on social media, the core emotion conveyed is `love` (the feeling of being loved, accepted, or cherished by others), not just general `joy`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Group Related Specific Emotions under Broader Categories:** If several specific emotions are expressed (e.g., \"embarrassed\" and \"humiliated\"), categorize them under the most appropriate broader emotional umbrella (e.g., `sadness` for feelings of shame and distress).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Acknowledge Nuance and Prioritize:** If multiple emotions seem to be present, identify and state the single *dominant* emotion. Your reasoning should explain the presence of other potential emotions and clearly justify why you selected the dominant one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your output must include a `reasoning` field, providing a detailed, step-by-step explanation for your choice, and an `emotion` field, stating the single dominant emotion in lowercase.\n",

      "\n",
      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words:** Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful\"). These are strong indicators. However, be aware that explicit negative emotional language can sometimes describe a *secondary* emotion or a rhetorical device, and the *dominant* emotion might lie deeper, especially when the user is making an observation or expressing an achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis) - *Crucial for Overriding Literal Interpretations*:**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, or a deeper truth, *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*. For example, saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",
      "        *   A sense of pride, satisfaction, or happiness in a personal achievement, a sustained positive effort, or a current positive state, even if they follow it with a nuanced or slightly critical observation about that achievement. The `joy` from the initial achievement or positive state often *predominates* over subsequent minor dissatisfactions or desired improvements. For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesnt feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between `Anger` and `Fear` in Intense Negative Experiences:**\n",
      "        *   When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task, obligation, or general experience*, consider the *intensity* and *nature* of the negative feeling. If the language used is extremely impactful and suggests intense dread, prolonged suffering, or an inescapable negative ordeal (e.g., \"tortured,\" \"tormented\"), the dominant emotion is `fear` or profound `sadness` due to the implied psychological or emotional threat and suffering. `Fear` typically involves apprehension about an impending or ongoing threat or inescapable distress, while profound `sadness` involves suffering and distress from an experienced or current negative state. This overrides simple `anger` or `frustration`, which would be more appropriate for mere annoyance, irritation, or resentment towards an unpleasant burden or inconvenience (e.g., \"I hate this task\").\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Sadness` from `Anger` in Negative Consequences or Perceived Injustice:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"punished,\" experiencing negative consequences, or suffering from a situation, the dominant emotion often leans towards `sadness`. This encompasses feelings of distress, helplessness, despair, regret, or being overcome by the negative circumstances. While there might be an underlying anger or resentment at a perceived injustice or the person/cause of the negative situation, the user's *personal experience of suffering the consequence* (e.g., \"I feel punished,\" \"this is unfair and hurts me\") is typically a manifestation of `sadness`. `Anger` is more about indignation, outrage, or a desire for retribution against the perceived wrongdoer or injustice itself, focusing on the external cause rather than the internal suffering.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Fear` from `Sadness` in Overwhelm/Stress:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feeling \"stressed\" or \"overwhelmed,\" consider the underlying cause:\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *anxiety about future threats, potential failure, or loss of control*, the dominant emotion is `fear`.\n",
      "            *   If the primary feeling is *helplessness, despair, or an inability to cope with current circumstances or demands*, often characterized by phrases like \"can't get my head around it,\" \"can't manage,\" or a sense of being defeated by the situation, the dominant emotion is `sadness`. `Sadness` encompasses feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, and being overcome by difficulties.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguishing `Joy` from `Love` in Social Affirmation:**\n",
      "        *   When a user expresses feelings related to positive social affirmation, differentiate carefully:\n",
      "            *   `Love` is the dominant emotion when the user describes feelings of *affectionate connection, being cherished, deeply cared for, or accepted intimately* by others (e.g., \"I feel loved,\" \"I feel liked\" in a way that implies personal acceptance and connection, \"I feel cherished\"). This refers to emotional bonds and deep personal regard or acceptance from others.\n",
      "            *   `Joy` is the dominant emotion when the user describes feelings of *satisfaction, pleasure, pride, or happiness derived from general positive recognition, respect, or affirmation of their worth, achievements, or status* in a broader social, professional, or non-intimate context (e.g., \"I feel respected,\" \"I got praise for my work,\" \"people acknowledge my efforts,\" receiving \"likes\" on social media which signifies general approval or popularity). This refers to recognition that might not be primarily affectionate but provides a sense of contentment and affirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",
      "    *   **Do not be misled by secondary or reflective emotions:** The dominant emotion might not be the most explicitly stated one, especially if explicit negative words are used to describe a *situation* while the user's underlying `joy` comes from their *insight* into that situation or their *achievement* related to it.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Group Related Specific Emotions under Broader Categories:** If several specific emotions are expressed (e.g., \"embarrassed\" and \"humiliated\"), categorize them under the most appropriate broader emotional umbrella (e.g., `sadness` for feelings of shame and distress).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Acknowledge Nuance and Prioritize:** If multiple emotions seem to be present, identify and state the single *dominant* emotion. Your reasoning should explain the presence of other potential emotions and clearly justify why you selected the dominant one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your output must include a `reasoning` field, providing a detailed, step-by-step explanation for your choice, and an `emotion` field, stating the single dominant emotion in lowercase.\n",

      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words & Their Nuance:**\n",
      "    *   Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful,\" \"regretful\"). These are strong indicators.\n",
      "    *   Pay close attention to the *intensity* and *specific meaning* of these words within the context. For instance, \"passionate\" often indicates strong enthusiasm, excitement, or deep interest in an activity, event, or item, which typically aligns with `joy` (pleasure, excitement, enthusiasm) rather than `love` (a deeper, enduring affection or strong emotional bond towards a person, deeply cherished concept, or profound appreciation).\n",
      "    *   Crucially, when the word \"love\" is explicitly used (e.g., \"i feel in love\"), **do not automatically categorize it as `love`**. Instead, *critically evaluate the object of love and the surrounding context*. If the \"love\" is directed towards an inanimate object, a temporary item, a casual concept, or an activity, and the sentiment is primarily one of strong enjoyment, enthusiasm, delight, or positive interest related to that item/activity, it is highly likely `joy`. Reserve `love` for expressions of deep, enduring affection towards individuals, pets, profoundly cherished ideals, or a profound, stable appreciation that transcends immediate pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis):**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   If the user expresses an opinion, observation, or makes a judgment (e.g., \"i feel like if he was innocent he wouldn t feel like he has anything to prove\"), determine if the user's primary emotion stems from a sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw or inconsistency, even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive.\n",
      "    *   **Self-indulgence and Anticipation:** If the user describes treating themselves, anticipating a personal benefit, or engaging in an act of self-gratification (e.g., \"i realize that while i am feeling generous i should definitely get myself some shoes it has been over a year\"), this positive anticipation and pleasure typically indicates `joy`.\n",

      "        *   **`Joy`** encompasses feelings of pleasure, happiness, excitement, enthusiasm, delight, gratification, and positive anticipation. It often relates to positive experiences, achievements, or positive engagement with an activity or item (e.g., pleasure in sharing a giveaway, excitement for new shoes).\n",
      "        *   **`Love`** denotes a deeper, more enduring affection, a strong emotional bond, or profound care. It is typically directed towards individuals, pets, deeply cherished concepts, or a profound appreciation that transcends mere enthusiasm (e.g., loving a family member, loving one's country, deep love for a hobby).\n",
      "        *   If a user expresses strong positive feelings like \"passionate\" about an item, event, or activity they are involved in or sharing, and this feeling drives an action, it is more often `joy` (excitement, pleasure in the activity/item) rather than `love` (deep affection or bond).\n",
      "        *   This distinction is especially vital when the word \"love\" is used explicitly. For example, \"i saw lil seb i feel in love and thought he be perfect to carry around with me\" is `joy`. Despite the explicit \"in love,\" the object \"lil seb\" (a likely item/toy or a small, non-sentient object) and the desire to \"carry around\" for exploration indicate delight, enthusiasm, and strong positive interest for the *experience* with the item, fitting `joy` rather than `love` (deep, enduring affection for a living being or profound concept). Always consider if the feeling is about immediate pleasure, excitement, or strong positive interest in an item/activity (`joy`), versus a deep, sustained emotional bond (`love`).\n",

      "Prompt:\n",
      "Determine the dominant emotion of the user message.\n",
      "\n",
      "When analyzing the user message, follow these detailed steps and considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Identify Explicit Emotion Words:** Give high priority to words in the message that directly state or describe emotions (e.g., \"embarrassed,\" \"humiliated,\" \"happy,\" \"angry,\" \"sad,\" \"fearful\"). These are strong indicators. However, be aware that explicit negative emotional language can sometimes describe a *secondary* emotion or a rhetorical device, and the *dominant* emotion might lie deeper, especially when the user is making an observation or expressing an achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Analyze Contextual Information:** Carefully examine the surrounding details, the specific situation described, and any implied meanings. The broader context can significantly influence the interpretation of explicit emotions or reveal emotions that are not directly stated. For example, the context of being an \"attack victim\" amplifies negative feelings of shame and distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Infer the User's Perspective and Stance (User-Centric Analysis) - *Crucial for Overriding Literal Interpretations*:**\n",
      "    *   Crucially, consider *how the user feels about the situation, observation, or judgment they are describing*, rather than just the literal content of what is being discussed.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritize the User's Act of Sharing/Observing:** If the user expresses an opinion, makes an observation or judgment, or shares a personal development, determine if the *primary emotion driving the message* stems from:\n",
      "        *   A sense of satisfaction, vindication, or pleasure in their own astute observation or the implication of that observation. This could indicate `joy` or `amusement` if they feel they have correctly identified a flaw, an inconsistency, or a deeper truth, *even if the subject matter itself isn't inherently positive or if explicit negative words are used to describe the situation*. In these cases, the `joy` is in the *insight itself*, the *act of understanding*, or the *act of articulating it clearly*. For example, saying \"I hate this feeling to see you that way\" might be a conventional expression of dismay, but the underlying dominant emotion could be the `joy` of having deeply understood and articulated the other person's self-limitation.\n",
      "        *   A sense of pride, satisfaction, or happiness in a personal achievement, a sustained positive effort, or a current positive state, even if they follow it with a nuanced or slightly critical observation about that achievement. The `joy` from the initial achievement or positive state often *predominates* over subsequent minor dissatisfactions or desired improvements. For example, \"I pray regularly now my prayer life doesnt feel passionate\" could be driven by `joy` in the regularity, with the lack of passion being a secondary observation.\n",
      "    *   **Distinguish between Task Aversion and Fear:** When a user describes strong negative feelings about a *task or obligation* (e.g., \"i have a task i hate to do,\" \"it makes me feel like I won't be tortured for long\"), the dominant emotion is typically `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` towards the unpleasantness or perceived burden of the task, rather than `fear` of actual physical harm or danger from the task itself. The word \"tortured\" in such contexts signifies intense dislike, annoyance, or indignation at being subjected to something unpleasant, not terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identify the Root Cause or Primary Driver of the Emotion:**\n",
      "    *   Messages can often contain multiple layers of feelings (e.g., an action driven by anger, followed by regret). Your task is to pinpoint the *fundamental, originating, or dominant emotion* that drives the user's expression in the message.\n",
      "    *   **Do not be misled by secondary or reflective emotions:** The dominant emotion might not be the most explicitly stated one, especially if explicit negative words are used to describe a *situation* while the user's underlying `joy` comes from their *insight* into that situation or their *achievement* related to it.\n",
      "    *   For instance, if a user describes taking hurtful actions (e.g., \"i made her feel like crap and i said i hated her\") and then provides a *reason* or *justification* for those actions (e.g., \"because shes never home anymore\"), assess whether that reason points to an underlying `anger`, `frustration`, or `resentment` that motivated the hurtful behavior. In such cases, the anger might be the dominant emotion, even if the user also implicitly expresses subsequent `regret` or `sadness` about their actions. Strong negative expressions like \"I hated her\" are often direct manifestations of intense anger or resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Group Related Specific Emotions under Broader Categories:** If several specific emotions are expressed (e.g., \"embarrassed\" and \"humiliated\"), categorize them under the most appropriate broader emotional umbrella (e.g., `sadness` for feelings of shame and distress).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Acknowledge Nuance and Prioritize:** If multiple emotions seem to be present, identify and state the single *dominant* emotion. Your reasoning should explain the presence of other potential emotions and clearly justify why you selected the dominant one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your output must include a `reasoning` field, providing a detailed, step-by-step explanation for your choice, and an `emotion` field, stating the single dominant emotion in lowercase.\n",

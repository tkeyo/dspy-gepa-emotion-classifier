The goal is to identify the single strongest and most overarching emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay particular attention to these nuanced interpretations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Distinguishing Anger from Sadness in Tasks:** If the message describes a difficult or disliked task, even if it involves personal discomfort (\"tortured\"), and the speaker expresses frustration, dislike (\"hate to do\"), or uses coping mechanisms to endure it, the emotion is likely `anger` (frustration, annoyance) towards the task itself, rather than `sadness` about the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identifying Anger in Response to Being Disliked/Hated:** If the message describes a situation where the speaker feels disliked, hated, or targeted by another person's negative emotions or actions (e.g., \"she still hated me\"), the predominant emotion is likely `anger` (frustration, resentment, indignation) rather than `fear`. `Fear` implies a perceived threat or danger, while `anger` in this context implies a reaction to perceived injustice, offense, or hostility directed towards the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Distinguishing Joy from Love/Other Positive Emotions:** `Joy` encompasses a broad range of positive feelings, including happiness, contentment, gratitude, privilege, and satisfaction with positive experiences or achievements. If the message expresses appreciation for a positive experience, a sense of being fortunate, or general happiness, the emotion is `joy`. `Love` should be reserved for expressions of deep affection, care, or romantic/familial attachment itself, rather than the positive feelings derived from such relationships or experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identifying Joy in the Face of Past Negativity or Challenges:** When a message contains negative descriptions of a person's past state or actions (\"cover yourself,\" \"locked yourself\") or expresses a negative feeling (\"i hate this feeling\"), but the overall context suggests empathy for positive change, recognition of potential, or satisfaction that a person is overcoming previous limitations, the speaker's emotion can be `joy`. This implies a focus on current or future positive development despite past struggles.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Recognizing Joy in Consistent Positive Action Despite Imperfection:** If the message describes engaging in a consistent positive action or habit (\"pray regularly now\"), even if the speaker notes a lack of intensity or passion (\"doesn't feel passionate\"), the primary emotion can still be `joy`. This reflects satisfaction with the act of consistency or progress itself, rather than sadness about the perceived imperfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Prioritizing Predominant Negative Emotions, Especially When Explicitly Named or Mitigated:** If a message contains a strong underlying negative emotion, especially if explicitly named or strongly implied, that negative emotion often remains predominant even if the message also describes actions or thoughts aimed at mitigating, coping with, or reducing that negative feeling. For example, explicitly stating \"feeling scared\" (e.g., \"I found out I was pregnant which is a lot... but it makes me feel a little less scared knowing that my doctor is watching everything\") still points to `fear` as the primary emotion, as the coping mechanisms indicate the *presence* of the underlying negative emotion rather than its absence or complete replacement by a positive one. Similarly, if a message initially contains a positive statement (e.g., \"i do love the idea\") but is immediately followed by an overwhelming expression of negative emotions (e.g., feeling ignored, lonely, frustrated, depressed), the predominant emotion should be classified as the strongest negative sentiment expressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Sadness Indicators:** Feelings of `guilt`, `boredom`, or `being ignored` (implying loneliness or neglect) are strong indicators that the predominant emotion is `sadness`. When `worry` is explicitly described as `mild` and not prompting action (e.g., \"mildly worried but not bad enough to actually pursue anything\"), it typically contributes to `sadness` rather than `fear`.\n",

      "Determine the predominant emotion expressed in the user message. Your analysis should go beyond surface-level keywords and consider the underlying intent, the broader context of the message, and the speaker's overall sentiment, especially when faced with seemingly contradictory phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay particular attention to these nuanced interpretations and guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Nuanced Interpretations (from previous instructions, still valid):**\n",
      "1.  **Distinguishing Anger from Sadness in Tasks:** If the message describes a difficult or disliked task, even if it involves personal discomfort (\"tortured\"), and the speaker expresses frustration, dislike (\"hate to do\"), or uses coping mechanisms to endure it, the emotion is likely `anger` (frustration, annoyance) towards the task itself, rather than `sadness` about the situation. This directive applies specifically when the 'discomfort' is clearly directed at an undesirable *task* or chore.\n",
      "2.  **Identifying Joy in the Face of Past Negativity or Challenges:** When a message contains negative descriptions of a person's past state or actions (\"cover yourself,\" \"locked yourself\") or expresses a negative feeling (\"i hate this feeling\"), but the overall context suggests empathy for positive change, recognition of potential, or satisfaction that a person is overcoming previous limitations, the speaker's emotion can be `joy`. This implies a focus on current or future positive development despite past struggles.\n",
      "3.  **Recognizing Joy in Consistent Positive Action Despite Imperfection:** If the message describes engaging in a consistent positive action or habit (\"pray regularly now\"), even if the speaker notes a lack of intensity or passion (\"doesn't feel passionate\"), the primary emotion can still be `joy`. This reflects satisfaction with the act of consistency or progress itself, rather than sadness about the perceived imperfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Refined and New Nuanced Interpretations (derived from feedback):**\n",
      "4.  **Differentiating Severe Distress from Task-Related Anger:** When words like \"tortured\" are used, carefully assess the *intensity* and *nature* of the suffering described. If it implies profound pain, helplessness, or a severe state of being under duress (beyond mere frustration with a difficult task), the emotion is more likely `fear` (due to vulnerability, impending harm, or an uncontrollable threat) or deep `sadness` (due to prolonged suffering), rather than `anger` directed at an \"it.\" Focus on the speaker's internal, deeply distressing experience of their situation.\n",
      "    *   *Example Application:* \"i feel so tortured by it\" – This suggests a state of profound suffering or distress, making `fear` a more appropriate classification than `anger` towards a task.\n",
      "5.  **Distinguishing Sadness/Regret (Internal State) from Outward Anger/Frustration:** If the speaker describes their own passive state of suffering, misfortune, being victimized, or regret (\"i feel like i'm being punished\"), even if the message includes an implied blame towards others or the cause of the situation, the predominant emotion about *their own predicament* is likely `sadness` or `regret`. `Anger` or `frustration` should be reserved for active, outward expressions of hostility, blame, or annoyance directed *at* someone or something specific, where the speaker is actively challenging or confronting, rather than lamenting their own unfortunate state. Prioritize the speaker's internal experience of their situation or misfortune.\n",
      "    *   *Example Application:* \"i feel like i m being punished gt gt gt gt gt something which you could have avoided by gosh just being honest\" – The core \"being punished\" reflects `sadness` about their own state, even if there's frustration at the cause.\n",
